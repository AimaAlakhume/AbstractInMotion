# AbstractInMotion
Graphics made with the turtle module in Python.

## Inspiration
As an electrical engineering major who makes art, I always search for overlaps between art and tech. Earlier this year, I visited my first digital art exhibit at Artechouse NYC. It was an incredibly immersive and serene experience that impacted me during a stressful time in my life.

## What it does
It displays colourful, visually appealing graphics that loosely resemble the celestial bodies in outer space. The project is intended to imbue tranquil feelings in the user.

## How we built it
It was created with an online Python compiler: Replit, with the Turtle graphics module.

## Challenges we ran into
The first challenge was changing the project idea. Initially, I planned to use data visualisation to generate graphics. However, because I wanted the data sets to directly relate to the drawings in mind, I would have needed to gather several specific data sets. Collecting that data would have taken more time than I had to spare.

The next challenge was being mindful of my available memory stores. Because I used an online compiler, I didn't have an abundance of memory, which caused some of the graphics to generate slower than others.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm proud of my time management. Although not as detailed as I would have liked, I created all the graphics I had in mind during the planning stage.

## What we learned
I realised that I have a lot to learn regarding the application of Python in projects. Since I have only ever coded in school, there has been a limit to my exposure and knowledge. I was doubtful when registering for this hackathon, but the experience has been positive and motivated me to apply for more. I hope that next time I can work with a team that will help me expand my knowledge.

## What's next for Abstract in Motion
I plan to go ahead with the data visualisation idea I had before. It's something I hope to keep building on, with different drawing ideas and accompanying data sets.
